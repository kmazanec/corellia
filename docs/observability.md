# Observability: the EventSink fan-out and the event → span mapping

Corellia's observability is the **event log itself** (ADR-003): every decision,
tool call, verdict, block, and spend is an append-only `FactoryEvent`. This note
covers the two seams that let that log be *watched* and *exported* without
changing it as the source of truth:

1. `corellia logs` — the local viewer (replay + `--follow` live tail).
2. The `EventSink` fan-out — the seam that ships the log to an external tracing
   backend (LangSmith, OTLP/Tempo/Datadog/Honeycomb).

The core stays dependency-free (ADR-001): the seam and the one reference sink
live in the eventlog layer; vendor SDKs live only in optional adapter modules
that a future change registers in `src/daemon/config.ts`.

## The `corellia logs` CLI

The `corellia` binary is a tiny subcommand dispatcher (`scripts/corellia.ts`).
Its first subcommand is `logs`, which reads the same store the daemon writes
(JSONL at `CORELLIA_EVENTS_PATH`, or Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`).

```
npm run logs -- [path] [--follow|-f] [--tree] [--cost] [--goal <substr>] [--type <evt>]
# or directly:
npx tsx scripts/corellia.ts logs [path] ...
```

- **Replay (default):** read a finished log and print the goal tree + per-goal
  detail, optionally a `--cost` summary. This is the graduated form of
  `scripts/trace.ts`; both share `src/eventlog/render.ts`.
- **`--follow` / `-f`:** the live tail. Streams new events as compact one-liners
  (`HH:MM:SS  <goal>  <detail>`) as they are appended, with a goal-tree snapshot
  reprinted when a new goal appears (enable with `--tree`). JSONL only — with
  `DATABASE_URL` set, follow declines honestly (Postgres polling by id is a
  possible follow-on).
- **Filters:** `--goal <substr>` narrows to a goal subtree; `--type <evt>` shows
  only that event type (the tree projection still sees every event so the
  snapshot stays complete).

### How `--follow` works

`src/eventlog/tail.ts` tracks a byte offset into the JSONL file and reads only
the bytes appended since the last read. New bytes are detected by `fs.watch`
where the platform delivers change events, with a polling interval (default
250 ms) as an always-correct fallback. A trailing **partial line** — a
half-written append at the tail — is held as a carry and prepended to the next
read, so an event split across two reads is reassembled rather than dropped.
Both the watch path and the poll path funnel through the same offset-advancing
read, and reads are serialized, so a spurious or missed watch event changes only
latency, never correctness. A file that shrinks (rotation/truncation) resets the
offset to 0.

## The `EventSink` fan-out seam

```ts
interface EventSink {
  emit(event: FactoryEvent): void;   // best-effort, must never throw into the store
  flush?(): Promise<void>;
}
```

- **Placement.** `EventSink` lives in `src/contract/events.ts` beside
  `EventStore`. `SinkFanoutStore` (`src/eventlog/sink-fanout-store.ts`) is a thin
  store *decorator*: it delegates `append` to the inner store, then — only after
  a durable append — calls each sink's `emit` inside a `try/catch`. A sink that
  throws is caught and dropped; **observability can never break the factory's
  durability.** `list` delegates unchanged.
- **Wiring.** `buildStore()` (`src/daemon/config.ts`) registers sinks from env
  and wraps the concrete store only when at least one sink is present (zero
  overhead and zero behavior change when none are). Today's implicit behavior —
  just persist to JSONL/PG — is the empty sink list.
- **Reference sink.** `StdoutSink` (`src/eventlog/stdout-sink.ts`) writes each
  event as one NDJSON line. Enable with `CORELLIA_SINK_STDOUT=1`. It proves the
  seam end-to-end with no dependency; the vendor adapters below replace the line
  writer with an SDK call and follow the exact same shape.

## The neutral event → span mapping

The goal tree already *is* a trace tree. Both the LangSmith and OTLP adapters
derive from this one mapping so they cannot drift; an adapter is mechanical once
this table is fixed.

| FactoryEvent | Span / run role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `goal-received` | **opens a span/run** for `goalId` | Root goal → root trace; child goal → child span. Run type from `goal.kind`: `make` → `chain`, `judge`/`decide`/`produce` → `llm`, a leaf's tool phase → `tool`. Name = `goal.title`. |
| `child-spawned` | **child span** nested under the parent | `childId` is the child's span id; `dependsOn` → span links. |
| `decided` | span **event** on the goal's span | `decision.kind`; `usage` → token counts on the span (see `usage`). |
| `tool-call` | span **event** (or short child `tool` span) | Attributes: `tool`, `outcome` (`ran`/`refused`), `reason`, bounded `args`. |
| `step` | span **event** | `index`, `outputKind`; `usage` → tokens. |
| `script-ran` / `capture-ran` | span **event** | `command`/`captureName`, `exitStatus`/`ok`, `durationMs`. |
| `deterministic-checked` / `judge-verdict` | span **event**; `pass=false` → sets **error status** | `judgeType`, `tier`, gating findings → attributes / run metadata. |
| `repair-applied` / `tier-escalated` | span **event** | Repair prescriptions; tier `from`→`to`. |
| `produced` / any `usage` | **token metrics** on the span | `promptTokens`, `completionTokens`, `cachedPromptTokens`, `costUsd`. |
| `ceiling-reached` / `budget-exhausted` | span **event**, warning | Spend/limit or exhausted dimension. |
| `blocked` | **closes the span with error status** | `brief.question`, `resolution` → status detail. |
| `emitted` | **closes the span** | ok if `report.blockers` is empty, else error status carrying the blockers. |
| `knowledge-*`, `pattern-*`, `worktree-*`, `pr-opened`, `branch-pushed`, `round-*` | span **events** with the event's salient fields as attributes | Non-load-bearing for the tree shape; carried as timeline events. |

Span timing: `at` (wall-clock ms) is the event time; a span's start is its
`goal-received.at` and its end is the `emitted`/`blocked` `at` for that `goalId`.

### OTLP / generic adapter (shipped) — `src/eventlog/otlp-sink.ts`

`OtlpSink` is the second concrete sink, proving the `EventSink` interface generic
against a real backend. It exports the goal tree over the **OTLP/HTTP JSON**
encoding with **no vendor SDK** — plain `fetch` POSTing `resourceSpans` to
`<endpoint>/v1/traces`. One exporter reaches Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog,
and any OTLP collector.

**Mapping to OTLP spans** (from the table above):

- `goal-received` **opens** a span: `name = goal.title`, `kind = INTERNAL`,
  `startTimeUnixNano = at`, attributes `corellia.goal.id` / `corellia.goal.type`.
- Parent linkage comes from `goal.parentId` (`parentSpanId = spanId(parentId)`);
  the root goal (`parentId === null`) is the trace root. `child-spawned` is also
  recorded as a span event carrying `dependsOn`.
- Step-shaped events (`tool-call`, `decided`, `step`, `judge-verdict`,
  `deterministic-checked`, `tier-escalated`, `repair-applied`, `script-ran`,
  `capture-ran`, `ceiling-reached`, `budget-exhausted`) become **span events** with
  their salient fields as attributes.
- Any `usage` accumulates onto the span as `corellia.usage.prompt_tokens` /
  `completion_tokens` / `cached_prompt_tokens` / `cost_usd`.
- A failing `judge-verdict` / `deterministic-checked` sets the span's status to
  **ERROR** even before it closes.
- `emitted` **closes** the span (ERROR status carrying `report.blockers` when
  non-empty, else UNSET); `blocked` closes it ERROR with `brief.question` and a
  `corellia.block.resolution` attribute.

**Ids.** Deterministic, no allocation: `traceId = sha256("trace:" + rootGoalId)`
(16 bytes / 32 hex) and `spanId = sha256("span:" + goalId)` (8 bytes / 16 hex),
via `node:crypto` (not a dependency). The trace id is resolved by walking
`parentId` links to the root, so every span in a tree shares one trace id.

**Batching & failure discipline.** `emit()` only folds into the in-memory span
buffer — it never blocks a run. A span is exportable **only once closed**; closed
spans POST in batches (default **50 spans** or every **5 s**, whichever first),
fire-and-forget. `flush()` drains everything at shutdown and marks any still-open
span `factory.incomplete=true` rather than dropping it. Every network error is
caught (the fan-out already guards against throws) and logged **at most once per
burst** — a success re-arms the next log — so a down collector never spams the
operator.

**Config** (env-gated in `buildSinks()`):

| Env var | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Presence **enables** the sink. Base collector URL; `/v1/traces` is appended if absent. |
| `CORELLIA_OTLP_HEADERS` | Optional JSON object of `{ header: value }` — how backends pass auth. A malformed value disables auth (with a warning), not the whole sink. |

**Honeycomb:**

```bash
export CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://api.honeycomb.io"
export CORELLIA_OTLP_HEADERS='{"x-honeycomb-team":"YOUR_API_KEY","x-honeycomb-dataset":"corellia"}'
```

**Grafana Cloud (Tempo, OTLP/HTTP endpoint):**

```bash
export CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT="https://otlp-gateway-<region>.grafana.net/otlp"
# instanceID:token base64-encoded, per Grafana Cloud's OTLP auth
export CORELLIA_OTLP_HEADERS='{"Authorization":"Basic <base64(instanceID:token)>"}'
```

A local collector (Grafana Tempo, an OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger's OTLP
receiver) needs only `CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"`.

### Notification webhook (shipped) — `src/eventlog/notification-sink.ts`

The trace sinks above export *everything* for later inspection. `NotificationSink`
is the complement: a **push** for the small set of moments a human needs to *know
about* right now, so an operator can walk away from the terminal instead of
polling `GET /status`. It POSTs one compact JSON payload per curated event to a
configured webhook (Slack, Discord, ntfy, an email bridge — all speak an incoming
webhook), and ignores every other event.

**The curated event set** — the only events that fire a POST:

| Event | Payload `kind` | Salient fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blocked` | `blocked` | `question`, `options`, `deadline` (absolute ms), `onTimeout`, `resolution`, `answerRoute` (`/intents/<id>/answer`) |
| `parked` | `parked` | `question`, `deadline` (from `ttlMs`), `answerRoute` |
| `resumed` | `resumed` | `answer` |
| `pr-opened` | `pr-opened` | `url`, `branch` |
| `emitted` **at a tree root** | `tree-done` / `tree-failed` | `blockers` when failed |
| `partial-delivered` | `tree-partial` | `blockedModules` |

Every payload also carries `goalId`, `at`, and a ready-to-render `text` one-liner
(the field most webhook bridges display directly). A tree terminal notifies **only
for the root goal** (`goal.parentId === null`, tracked from `goal-received`), never
for a child emitting its report on the way up.

**Failure discipline** mirrors the OTLP sink: `emit()` never blocks a run (the POST
is fire-and-forget under a short timeout, default 5 s), every network error is
caught and logged **at most once per burst**, and the sink never throws into the
fan-out. There is **no retry** — a notification is best-effort and the durable
record is always the event log; observability never blocks durability.

**Config** (env-gated in `buildSinks()`):

| Env var | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CORELLIA_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK` | Presence **enables** the sink. The URL every payload is POSTed to. |
| `CORELLIA_NOTIFY_HEADERS` | Optional JSON object of `{ header: value }` for webhook auth (a token, a shared secret). A malformed value disables auth (with a warning), not the whole sink — the same lenient parse as `CORELLIA_OTLP_HEADERS`. |

```bash
export CORELLIA_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX"
# optional auth, e.g. a bearer token or a shared secret the receiver checks:
export CORELLIA_NOTIFY_HEADERS='{"Authorization":"Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}'
```

### Watch a run in Jaeger (bundled, profile `observe`)

`compose.yaml` carries an optional **`observe` profile** that adds a Jaeger
all-in-one container — the cheapest graphical view of a run, no external backend
needed. It is a profile, so a plain `docker compose up` stays two containers
(daemon + postgres) and default deploys are unchanged.

```bash
CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://jaeger:4318 docker compose --profile observe up
# then open the Jaeger UI:
open http://localhost:16686
```

The daemon's OTLP sink posts straight to Jaeger's in-network OTLP/HTTP receiver
(`http://jaeger:4318`), and every goal, attempt, and judge verdict appears as a
trace waterfall. All-in-one is **in-memory only** — a fresh start drops prior
traces; it is a live-watch surface, not durable storage. For a durable/production
backend, point `CORELLIA_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at Honeycomb or Grafana Tempo (above); the
`observe` profile deliberately does **not** ship in the production `compose.deploy.yaml`.

### LangSmith adapter (remains open)

The LangSmith run-tree adapter (gated on `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`) is still the one
documented-but-unbuilt follow-on. It maps the same events to LangSmith's nested
`run` model; it would live in its own module and register in `buildSinks()` the
same way `OtlpSink` does, keeping the LangSmith SDK out of `src/` core.
